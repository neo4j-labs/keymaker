# Keymaker UI

The React UI code for Keymaker

## Install Dependencies

### Install dependencies:

Run:

```
npm install
```

### Configure the .env file

Create a .env file by copying the .env.example file to .env. If you haven't changed any of the default port settings, no changes should be required to your .env file.

## Start the API

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000/login to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
